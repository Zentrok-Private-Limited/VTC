                    <strong>Calcium-Based Desiccants</strong> are high-performance moisture absorbers made primarily
                    from <strong>calcium chloride (CaCl₂)</strong>. They work by absorbing moisture from the air and converting it into a
                    liquid or gel form, making them highly effective in high-humidity environments. Compared to
                    traditional silica gel, calcium-based desiccants offer much higher moisture absorption capacity.
                    They are commonly used in in-box packaging for electronics, pharmaceuticals, garments, food
                    packaging, and other moisture-sensitive products to protect them from humidity damage.

                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    One of the key advantages of calcium-based desiccants is their ability to provide <strong>long-lasting
                    moisture control</strong>, even during sea freight, long-term storage, and humid climate conditions. These
                    desiccants are designed with leak-proof packaging to safely contain absorbed moisture. Because of
                    their strong and reliable performance, they are widely used in logistics, export packaging, and
                    industrial applications to prevent corrosion, mold growth, and product deterioration.
