    <p class="text-gray-700 text-base pb-3 leading-relaxed">VTC empowers businesses to safeguard their goods against moisture-related damage during
        transportation and
        storage. Our solutions help preserve product quality, maintain value, and significantly reduce losses and waste.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-700 text-base pb-3 leading-relaxed">Since its inception, VTC has been committed to becoming a trusted leader in moisture damage
        prevention, driving
        innovation in advanced desiccant technologies and solutions tailored for modern supply chains.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-700 text-base pb-3 leading-relaxed"> We pioneered the introduction of calcium chloride–based, starch-supported in-box desiccants,
        redefining how
        moisture protection is applied within packaging. Through advanced engineering, high-performance packaging
        materials, and newly developed sealing technologies, VTC created a highly efficient moisture-absorbing solution
        that can be placed in direct contact with goods vulnerable to moisture damage—an application previously limited
        to conventional and less effective desiccants such as silica gel or clay.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-700 text-base pb-3 leading-relaxed">By continuously advancing our products, materials, and manufacturing processes, VTC drives progress
        within the
        industry. Our focus remains on delivering superior cargo protection solutions while optimizing usage through
        intelligent product design—ensuring maximum performance with minimal material application.</p>
