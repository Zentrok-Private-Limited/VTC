                    <strong>Moisture damage</strong> occurs when excess humidity comes into
                    contact with products during storage or transportation. It can lead to issues such as corrosion,
                    mold growth, material degradation, and loss of product quality.

                    Many products are vulnerable to moisture, including electronics, pharmaceuticals, textiles, food
                    items, and industrial components. Even small amounts of trapped moisture can cause long-term damage
                    if not properly controlled.

                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    Moisture can originate from environmental humidity, packaging materials, temperature fluctuations,
                    or condensation formed during transit. Changes in climate and long shipping durations further
                    increase the risk of moisture-related problems.

                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    Effective moisture control solutions help prevent damage, protect product integrity, and reduce
                    financial losses. Using the right desiccants and packaging methods ensures safe storage, reliable
                    transportation, and extended product life.

                    Goods shipped in sea containers are highly vulnerable to moisture damage because the enclosed
                    container environment creates ideal conditions for condensation. During sea transport, temperature
                    fluctuations cause warm, moisture-laden air to cool, leading to condensation as cooler air holds
                    less moisture.

                    When temperatures fall below the dew point, moisture condenses on the inner surfaces of the
                    container,
                    particularly on the ceiling and walls. These water droplets can drip onto the cargo, a phenomenon
                    known
                    as <strong>container rain</strong>. Moisture may also form inside packaging, referred to as
                    <strong>cargo sweat</strong>.

                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    These condensation cycles often repeat throughout the journey as containers pass through changing
                    climates. Over time, repeated exposure increases the risk of mold growth, corrosion, deformation,
                    malfunction, and unpleasant odors, ultimately affecting product quality and usability.
